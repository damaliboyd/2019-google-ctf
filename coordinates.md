# Enter Space-Time Coordinates

* **Category:** easiest
* **Points:** 1

## Challenge

> Ok well done. The console is on. It's asking for coordinates. Beating heavily on the console yields little results, but the only time anything changes on your display is when you put in numbers.. So what numbers are you going to go for? You see the starship's logs, but is there a manual? Or should you just keep beating the console?

## Solution
1. Download and unzip the file
2. Run the following command on rand2
    *   ``` rabin2 -z rand2```

```
