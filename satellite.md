## Challenge

> Placing your ship in range of the Osmiums, you begin to receive signals. Hoping that you are not detected, because it's too late now, you figure that it may be worth finding out what these signals mean and what information might be "borrowed" from them. Can you hear me Captain Tim? Floating in your tin can there? Your tin can has a wire to ground control? Find something to do that isn't staring at the Blue Planet.
